<h1>Blue whales and sperm whales</h1>
<h3>Blue whales</h3>
<p>How do right whales size up? North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) are big, but they're not the biggest
    whales. That distinction goes to the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), the largest animal on Earth. The orca's
    (Orcinus orca) size of up to 31 feet (9.4 meters) makes it the largest dolphin. <p>The sperm whale (Physeter
    macrocephalus), on the other hand, may not be the biggest whale, but it has the biggest brain to have ever existed
    on Earth. A comparison chart of whale sizes helps put it all in perspective!</p>
<h3>Sperm whales</h3>
<p>Sperm whales are easily recognized by their massive heads and prominent rounded foreheads.

    Spermaceti and Diving Capabilities

    They have the largest brain of any creature known to have lived on Earth. Their heads also hold large quantities of
    a substance called spermaceti. Whalers once believed that the oily fluid was sperm, but scientists still do not
    understand the function of spermaceti. <p>One common theory is that the fluid—which hardens to wax when cold—helps the
        whale alter its buoyancy so it can dive deep and rise again. Sperm whales are known to dive as deep as 3,280 feet in
        search of squid to eat. These giant mammals must hold their breath for up to 90 minutes on such dives.</p>
