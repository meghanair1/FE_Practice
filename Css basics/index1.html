    <H1>This experiment involves making a lava lamp</h1>
    <p class ="instruction">instructions</p>
    <ol>
        <li> Fill the bottle up about 1/4th (1 quarter) with water.
           <li> Pour the vegetable oil in the bottle until is almost full. You may want to use a measuring cup with a spout or a funnel. 
               You may have to wait a couple of minutes for the oil and water to separate.</li>
            <li> Add a few drops of your favorite food coloring. Watch as the color sinks through the oil. </li>
        <li> Did your drops of color mix with the water immediately or float in between for a few minutes?</li>
    <li> Break your fizzy tablet in half and drop part of it into the bottle. Get ready â€¦ here come the bubbly blobs!</li>
<li>   You can even get a flashlight, turn off the lights and drop in another half tablet. This time shine the flashlight through the lava lamp while the blobs are bubbling!</li>
